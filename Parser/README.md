## Parser 
* In this phase, the tokens generated by the lexer is used to create grammar for c language
* The ast of C language is also created in this phase.
* To verify the parsing, pretty printing is done to see the effect of parsing.

## What can be parsed
* Almost primitives types are added :
	* int
	* char
	* void
	* char
	* float
	* double
	* long
* identifiers
* multiline comments, singleline comments
* directives (#include and #define)
* all kinds of seperators in c 
* all kinds of assignments in c (including +=, -=, /=, *=, etc)
* all kinds of operators in c (including bitwise, binary, unary, logical, comparision)
* increment and decrement operators
* ternary operators
* strings 
* Function calls 

**Among the statements, only following statements are allowed : **

* if statement
* if-else statement
* declarations of variables
* declarations with initialization of variables
* return statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* block statement ({...})
* while loop
* (any expression) semicolon 

## What's not covered

* some primitive types are not covered
	* short
	* signed int/char/float/long/double
	* unsigned int/char/float/long/double
	* register
	* static int/char/float/long/double
	* const int/char/float/long/double
* Array types are not covered
* Pointers are not covered
* For loop, do while loop are not covered
* switch statement is not covered
* structures, unions are not covered
* function protoypes are not covered

## How to run
All test files for Parser are present in Parser/Tests folder

**To run three files test1.c, test2.c, test3.c present in Tests folder**
